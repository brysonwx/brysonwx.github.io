Hello, this is Weixin Bu (Also, Bryson), an ordinary but curious person.

I'm consistently exploring some things of interest, while also striving to learn from those who are both pure-hearted and outstanding. I believe that life is a vast wilderness, and the key is to spend it in the way you truly love.

I am now working at [REVERSIBLE INC](https://www.reversible.com) as a [Search and Recommendation Engineer], including the pipeline construction, performance optimization and multimodal implementation of the search and recommendation systems.
Additionally, I am exploring innovative applications of LLMs for automated code bug fix, while also working on advanced image inpainting / outpainting technologies.

I graduated from [School of Computer and Software](https://scs.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (南京信息工程大学计算机与软件学院) with a bachelor's degree; and from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.jlu.edu.cn), Jilin University (吉林大学人工智能学院) with a master's degree.

I am passionate about researching on Artificial Intelligence (Graph Neural Networks, Self/Semi-supervised Learning, Multimodal Learning, and Large Foundation Models, etc) and Software Development (AI for Software Development, Large-Scale Distributed Systems, etc).
