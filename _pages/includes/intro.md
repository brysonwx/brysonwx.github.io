Hello, this is Weixin Bu (Also, Bryson), an ordinary but curious person.

I persistently explore the things that spark my interest, while striving to learn from those who are both pure-hearted and outstanding. I believe that life is a vast wilderness, and the key is to live it in a way you truly love.

- I am now working at [REVERSIBLE INC](https://www.reversible.com) as a [Search and Recommendation Engineer], maintaining the pipeline construction, performance optimization and multimodal implementation of the search and recommendation system. Additionally, I'm also exploring innovative applications of LLMs for automated code bug fix, while also researching on advanced image inpainting / outpainting technologies.

- I graduated from [School of Computer and Software](https://scs.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (南京信息工程大学计算机与软件学院) with a bachelor's degree; and from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.jlu.edu.cn), Jilin University (吉林大学人工智能学院) with a master's degree.

- I am passionate about researching on Artificial Intelligence (Graph Neural Networks[Homogeneous/Heterogeneous, Static/Dynamic Graphs], Self/Semi-supervised Learning, Multimodal Learning, and Large Foundation Models, etc) and Software Development (AI for Software Development, etc).
