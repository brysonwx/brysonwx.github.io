Hello, this is Weixin Bu (Also, Bryson), an ordinary but curious person.

I work at [REVERSIBLE INC](https://www.reversible.com) as a [Search and Recommendation Engineer]. I am now working on the pipeline construction, performance optimization and multimodal implementation of the search and recommendation systems.

I graduated from [School of Computer and Software](https://scs.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (南京信息工程大学计算机与软件学院) with a bachelor's degree; and from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.jlu.edu.cn), Jilin University (吉林大学人工智能学院) with a master's degree.

I am passionate about researching on Artificial Intelligence and Software Development. My research interests include Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Self/Semi-supervised Learning, Multimodal Learning, and Large Foundation Models, etc.
